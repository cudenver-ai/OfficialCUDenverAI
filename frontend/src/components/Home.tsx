                        <p>This challenge invites all Auraria Campus students to dive into the intriguing world of adversarial machine learning by crafting adversarial examples that can deceive a robust machine learning classifier trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Your mission is to create subtle but effective modifications to a set of test images, fooling the classifier into making incorrect predictions. This challenge is a perfect opportunity for students to explore model vulnerabilities, gain hands-on experience with adversarial techniques, and contribute to ongoing research in AI robustness and security.</p>
